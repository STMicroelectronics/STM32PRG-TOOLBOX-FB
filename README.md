# PRG-TOOLBOX-FB

Fastboot is a protocol that was originally created for Android and is primarily used to modify the flash filesystem via a USB connection from a host computer. 
PRG-TOOLBOX-FB is designed to take advantage of its high transfer bandwidth to update or write to external flash memory for STM32MP devices (like eMMC, SDMMCâ€¦) using the standalone tool named "fastboot".

The project is a wrapper of fastboot tool, specifically designed for STM32MP products.
